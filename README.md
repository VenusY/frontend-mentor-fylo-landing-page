# frontend-mentor-fylo-landing-page
Solution to the Frontend Mentor Fylo landing page challenge using HTML and CSS.

Overall layout was created using normal HTML and CSS (i.e. no flexbox, grid. etc.). Flexbox was only used in sections of the landing page where content had to be placed horizontally, such as the main and header sections.
